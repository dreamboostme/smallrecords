----

## Records

> Main idea behind this plugin is to have a place where I can easily collect records in several lists (like portfolio, partners, sliders and their images, simple photo galleries, etc.).

### Records lists

Create one or more lists of records and assign form fields that you want to be visible in the list.

*Created list will be appended to the top of the side menu in Records administration.*

#### Custom repeater fields

When creating a new list you can allow predefined form fields or you can **create your own form** definition (based on repeater).

On tab `Custom repeater` allow its use, set basic settings and **add new fields**.

*Look inside a default `Record detail` component partial to see how to work with custom repeater data.*

## Categories

Here you can set up categories hierarchy (it is a nested tree).

*There are components ready to use for categories listing in Twig.*

## Tags

Simple list of tags that can be assigned to records.

## Attributes

If you need to store a specific information for your records, that is not covered by fields in record's form, here you can define a name of an attribute and it's type (string, text, number, switch).

If Attributes are allowed in Records list, you can select an attribute and add a value.

### Access attributes in Twig

If you assigned one or more attributes to any record, you can iterate through them with Twig code like:

````
{% for attribute in record.attributes %}

    {{ attribute.name }} : {{ attribute.value }}

{% endfor %}
````
Or there are functions to get a specific attribute (or attribute's value) by slug like:
````

    {{ record.getAttributeBySlug('my-attribute-slug') }}

    {{ record.getAttributeValueBySlug('my-attribute-slug') }}

````

## Import and Export

There are buttons ready in Records and Categories lists.

Component's default partials are meant as templates - you should customize them to your needs as these can change in a future!

Best way to customize them is to copy them to yout theme folder like:
